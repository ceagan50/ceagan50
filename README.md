A few more questions to make your profile even better:

1. Do you want to include a short professional summary or tagline (e.g., "AI Enthusiast & Python Developer")?
2. Any favorite projects or repositories you want to highlight?
3. Would you like to include social/portfolio links (LinkedIn, website, etc.)?
4. Any fun facts, hobbies, or personal interests to share?
